# Great-Cal-Poly-Underground

This problem emphasizes the design and coding of an object-oriented application using multiple arrays, classes, and methods.  Sequence, selection, and iteration logic are also used, as are logical program blocks, input/output dialogs, and the object-messaging model. 

The Great Cal Poly Underground exists as a network of rooms on a two-dimensional array.  Each room provides a virtual environment that together can be assembled into a simulated world.  The ability to manipulate virtual environments is fast becoming a central element in business simulations.  In this project, you will construct the GCPU using the Java programming language.  Details are provided in the following sections

To read and write the contents of a text file.  This problem emphasizes the design and coding of an object-oriented application using multiple classes, objects, and methods. 

Ability to load, save, and restore the existing state of the underground to a text file.
